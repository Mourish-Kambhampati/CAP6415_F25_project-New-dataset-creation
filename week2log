Week 2 – Data Collection and Annotation Setup

This week, I started working on the new dataset creation for road and highway vehicle detection.  
I collected images of roads and highways that include different vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles.  
The images were taken from different angles, locations, and times of day to add variety to the dataset.  
I created a local folder structure to store the raw images in an organized way.  
I installed LabelImg and tested it on a few images to draw bounding boxes around the vehicles.  
I also decided on the main classes I will use for labeling.  
Overall, this week focused on starting the dataset and preparing a smooth annotation workflow.
