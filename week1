This week, I focused on understanding the project requirements and defining the overall workflow for building the vehicle detection system.
I researched different object detection models and decided to use YOLO because of its speed and accuracy.
I also explored various datasets and identified the types of images I would need for training.
To stay organized, I planned the folder structure for storing raw images, annotations, and processed data.
Additionally, I reviewed tools like LabelImg and Roboflow to determine which one would fit best for the annotation work.
Overall, this week was about planning, exploring model options, and preparing the resources needed for the upcoming stages.
