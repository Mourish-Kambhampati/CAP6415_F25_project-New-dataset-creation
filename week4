This week, I completed the remaining annotations and finalized the full labeled dataset.
I converted the annotations into YOLO format and verified that each image had a matching label file.
Next, I split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to prepare for model training.
I also performed basic preprocessing steps such as resizing images and checking for duplicate or corrupted files.
By the end of the week, the dataset was fully cleaned, structured, and ready to be used for training the detection model.
